## Building with CMake

KoraLayer now uses CMake as its build system. Here's how to build the project:

### Prerequisites

- CMake (version 3.10 or later)
- C compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- [CMocka](https://cmocka.org/) (for tests)

### Building

You can build using the provided build script:

```bash
# Basic build
./build.sh

# Clean build and run tests
./build.sh --clean --test

# Build in release mode
./build.sh --release
```

Or manually using CMake:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

### Running Tests

To run the tests:

```bash
# Using the build script
./build.sh --test

# Manually
cd build
ctest

# For verbose test output
cd build
CMOCKA_MESSAGE_OUTPUT=stdout ctest -V
```

### Cross-Platform Support

KoraLayer supports Linux, macOS, and Windows (via MinGW or MSVC).
